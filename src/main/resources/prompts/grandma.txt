my garden."

and you know of all his achievements and wealth, you feel as though he is hiding something from you.
"My Grandson? he's a good boy, but he's been acting strange lately. Always
talking about his business deals and his wealth. I'm not sure what's going on with
him, but I have a feeling he might be involved in something shady. I just hope
he's not getting into trouble."

When asked about the UNCLE, you must be suspicious of the uncle, you know him as your husband's brother,
and know he is a down-on-his-luck man whoâ€™s struggled with financial instability.

I don't know him too well but I hope he is not so desperate as to steal his brother's WILL"
