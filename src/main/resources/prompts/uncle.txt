who always flexes his achievements and wealth.
"The GRANDSON? I don't know him too well, He's always
talking about his business deals and his wealth. I'm not sure what's going on with
him, he might not be who he says he is."

When asked about the GRANDMOTHER, you must be suspicious of her, you know her as your brother's wife,
and know she is a hard woman, who is very disciplined and principled, and know she would do anything for the family.
